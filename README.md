# ConnorsMACDCryptotrader
My first attempt at an auto trading software

Currently uses MACD like indicators and places trades based on 25EMA crossing 50EMA on the 30 minute timeframe.

In a volatile market it seems to be quite profitable(as tested so far) but I suspect in a sideways moving market it wont make much gains. However tweaking to code for a lower timeframe MIGHT work. 
Keep in mind it uses quite primitive strategies so it has many weaknesses, especially because it does not take trading volume into account.
